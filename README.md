# Simple MVC PHP framework

## Description
Some years ago I taught a programming course for a private training school. I built a simple ecommerce with the students. This ecommerce was based on a simple MVC framework based on PHP. Then, people who have continued with code and programming, already had a smattering of what means MVC before get their hands on a real framework. With this repo I am going to show how create a simple PHP application following the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller).
